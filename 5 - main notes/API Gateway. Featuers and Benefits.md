## API Gateway. Featuers and Benefits

An API Gateway serves as a single entry point for client requests in a microservices architecture, providing centralized management of various cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and more.

### Scenario: Without API Gateway

Imagine an e-commerce platform using a microservice architecture with services like Products, Orders, Users, and Static Content. Without an API Gateway, each microservice must handle its own cross-cutting concerns:

#### Example of Cross-Cutting Concerns

1. **Authentication & Authorization**: 
	- URLs like `/admin/users` should be accessible only to admins, requiring authentication and authorization logic in the Users Microservice.
	- URLs like `/myorders` should be accessible only to authenticated users, requiring similar logic in the Orders Microservice.

2. **Rate Limiting**:
	- To prevent abuse, each microservice must implement rate limiting independently.

3. **Monitoring**: 
	- Implementing client request and response time monitoring in each service separately is necessary for performance analysis.

#### Problems

1. **Duplication of Effort**: Each service needs to implement similar logic, leading to redundancy.

2. **Maintenance Overhead**: Updating shred logic across all services can be time-consuming and error-prone.

3. **Inconsistent Policies**: Different teams implementing security features may lead to inconsistencies.

### Solution: API Gateway

An API Gateway can centralize these concerns, implementing them once and applying them across all microservices. This reduces duplication, simplifies maintenance, and ensures consistency.

### Key Features of an API Gateway

#### 1. Authentication

API Gateway can handle authentication by verifying client credentials (e.g., JWT tokens) before forwarding requests to microservices. This centralizes authentication logic, ensuring that only authenticated users can access resources like `/myorders`.

#### 2. Authorization

After authenticating a client, API Gateway checks permissions to access specific resources. For example, only admin users can access `/admin/users`, ensuring secure access control across microservices.


#### 3. Static Content Delivery

API Gateway can directly serve static content (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) without involving backend services, enhancing performance and reducing the load on microservices.

#### 4. Caching 

To improve response times and reduce load on backend services. API Gateway can cache responses for frequently requested resources. For example, `/products` responses can be cached to serve repeated requests quickly.

#### 5. Aggregator

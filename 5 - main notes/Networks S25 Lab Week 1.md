## Networks S25 Lab Week 1
**Which types of communication channels do you know?**
- wired
- wireless

**Which hardware is used to connect computer to computer network?**
Network Interface Controller (NIC)

**What characteristics of Network Interface Card do you know?**
- To transmit (put) data (of binary format) into network channel;
- To take data from a network channel;
- Emposes a "transmission delay", when transmitting or receiving data (it is different from "transport delay")

**What is the difference between transfer and transmission delay?**
*Transmission delay* - the time taken to transmit a packet from the host to the channel.
*Transfer delay* - the time taken by packet to go through channel to reach the destination.

**What is the data packet?**
Small block of data to be translated which size depends on the specific protocol.

**Why data is divided into packets?**
- Improves transmission rates.
- Enable multiple computers to share the same connection.

## Ch 10. Joins
### Joins 
Joins are one of the most important SQL offers. Joins allows us to make use of the relationships we have set up between our tables. In short, joins allow us to query multiple tables at the *same time*.

#### Inner Join
The simplest and most common type of join SQL is the `INNER JOIN`. By default, a `JOIN` command is an `INNER JOIN`. An `INNER JOIN` returns all of the records in `table_a` that have matching records in `table_b` as demonstrated by the following Venn diagram.

#### On
To perform a table join, we need to tell the database how to "match up" the rows from each table. The `ON` clause specifies the columns from each table that should be compared.

When the same column name exists in both tables, we have to **specify which each column comes from** using the table name (or an alias) followed by a dot `.` before the column name.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.departmend_id = departments.id;
```


In this query:
- `employees.department_id` refers to the `department_id` column from the `employees` table.
- `departments.id` refers to the `id` column from the `departments` table.

The `ON` clause ensures that rows are matched based on these columns, creating a relationship between the two tables.

The query above returns *all* the fields from *both* tables. The `INNER` keyword only affects the number of *rows* returned, not the number of *columns*. The `INNER JOIN` filters rows based on matching `department_id` and `id`, while the `SELECT *` ensures all columns from both tables are included.

#### Why Is This Important?
In many databases, different tables might share the same column names, such as `id`. If you don't specify the table name (or alias) for a column, the database won't know which column to use for the join. For example, writing `ON id = id` won't work because the database can't distinguish between the `id` columns in each table.

### Namespacing on Tables
When working with multiple tables, you can specify which table a field exists on using a `.`. For example:

> `table_name.column_name`

```sql
SELECT students.name, classes.name
FROM students
INNER JOIN classes ON classes.class_id = students.class_id
```

The above query returns the `name` field from the `students` table and the `name` field from the `classes` table.

### Left Join
A `LEFT JOIN` will return every record from `table_a` regardless of whether or not any of those records have a match in `table_b`. A left join will *also* return any matching records from `table_b`. Here is a Venn diagram to help visualize the effect of a `LEFT JOIN`.

A small trick you can do to make writing the SQL query easier is define an *alias* for each table. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name 
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

### Right Join
A `RIGHT JOIN` is, as you may expect, the opposite of a `LEFT JOIN`. It returns all records from `table_b` regardless of matches, and all matching records between the two tables.

A `RIGHT JOIN` is just a `LEFT JOIN` with the order of the tables switched, so in most cases `LEFT JOIN` is preferred for readability.

### Full Join
A `FULL JOIN` combines the result set of the `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` commands. It returns *all* records from both `table_a` and `table_b` regardless of whether or not they have matches.

## Ch 11. Performance
### SQL Indexes
An index is an in-memory structure that ensures that queries we run on a database are *performant*, that is to say, they run *quickly*. Most database indexes are just *binary tree* or *B-trees*! The binary tree can be stored in *ram* as well as on *disk*, and it makes it easy to lookup the location of an entire row.

`PRIMARY KEY` columns are indexes by default, ensuring you can look up a row by its `id` very quickly. However, if you have other columns that you want to be able to do quick lookups on, you'll need to *index* them.

#### CREATE INDEX

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
```

It's fairly common to name an index after the column it's created on with a suffix of `_idx`.

### Index Review
As we discussed, an index is a data structure that can perform quick lookup. By indexing a column, we create a new in-memory structure, usually a binary-tree, where the values in the indexed column are sorted into the tree to keep lookups fast. It terms of Big-O complexity, a binary tree index ensures that lookups are $O(\log(n))$. 

#### Shouldn't We Index Everything? We Can Make the Database Ultra-Fast!
While indexes make specific kinds of lookups much faster, they also add performance overhead - they can slow down a database on other ways. Think about it, if you index every column every column, you could have hundreds of binary trees in memory! That needlessly bloats the memory usage of your database. I also means that each time you *insert* a record, that record needs to be added to *many* trees - slowing down your insert speed.

The rule of thumb is simple:

> Add an index to columns you know you'll be doing frequent lookups on. Leave everything else un-indexed. You can always add indexes later.

### Multi-Column Indexes
Multi-column indexes are useful for the exact reason you might think - they speed up lookups that depend on *multiple* columns.

#### CREATE INDEX

```sql
CREATE INDEX first_name_last_name_age_idx
ON users (first_name, last_name, age);
```

A multi-column index is sorted by the first column first, the second column next, and so forth. A lookup on *only* the first column in a multi-column index gets almost all of the performance improvements that it would get from its own single-column index. However, lookups on only the second or third column will have very degraded performace.

#### Rule of Thumb
Unless you have specific reasons to do something special, only add multi-column indexes if you're doing frequent lookups on a specific combination of columns.

### Denormalizing for Speed
We left you with a cliffhanger in the "normalization" chapter. As it turns out, data integrity and deduplication come at a cost, and that cost is *usually* speed.

Joining tables together, using subqueries, performing aggregations, and running post-hoc calculation *take time*. At very large scales these advanced techiques can actually become a *huge* performance toll on application - sometimes grinding the database server to a halt.

Storing duplicate information can drastically speed up an application that needs to look it up in *different ways*. For example, if you store a user's country information right on their user record, no expensive join is required to load their profile page!

That said, *denormalize at your own risk*! Denormalizing a database incurs a large risk of inaccurate and buggy data.

In my opinion, it should be used as a kind of "last resort" in the name of speed.

### SQL Injection
SQL is a *very* common way hackers attempt to cause damage or breach a database.

The joke here is that if someone was using this query:

```sql
INSERT INTO students(name) VALUES (?);
```

And the "name" of a student was `'Robert'); DROP TABLE students;--` then the resulting SQL query would look like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO students(name) VALUES ('Robert'); DROP TABLE students;--)
```

As you can see, this is actually 2 queries? The first one inserts "Robert" into the database, and the second one *deletes the students table*!

#### How Do We Protect Against SQL Injection?
You need to be aware of SQL injection attacks, bot to be honest solution these days is to simply use a modern SQL library that sanitizes SQL inputs. We don't often need to sanitize inputs by hand at the application level anymore.

For example, the Go standard library's SQL packages automatically protects your inputs against SQL attacks if you use it properly. In short, don't interpolate user input raw strings yourself - make sure your database library has a way to sanitize inputs, and pass it those raw values.

## Lab Week 1 Questions

<details>
<summary>Which types of communication channels do you know?</summary>
There are wired and wireless communication channels.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Which hardware is used to connect computer to computer network?</summary>
Network Interface Card (NIC).
</details>
<details>
<summary>What characteristics of Network Interface Card do you know?</summary>
It translates data to a binary format in order to put it into a network channel. Receives and decodes data from a network channel. Imposes a "transmission delay", when transmitting or receiving data.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the difference between transfer and transmission delay?</summary>
The channel imposes a transfer delay, whereas the transmission delay arises due to the Network Interface Card.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the data packet?</summary>
The block of data of a predefined size to be sent across a network.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Why data is divided into packets?</summary>
Instead of transferring a huge file as a single data block, sending it in smaller packets improves transmission rates. Packets also enable multiple computers to share the same connection. They also ensure fair resource sharing and help to avoid network congestion.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is communication protocol?</summary>
The agreement on technical communication details between network nodes. (HTTP, SMPT, IMAPS, VoIP, etc.)
</details>
<details>
<summary>What Communication Protocol purposes do you know?</summary>
The secure and efficient data transfer between nodes over a network.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Which examples of the communication protocols do you know.</summary>
HTTP, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, SMTP, IMAP, POP
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the Time Division Multiplexing protocol?
</summary>
TDM protocol assigns time slots for each node to send data over a single channel.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What number of hosts can be participants in TDM?
</summary>
There is no strict upper bound for number of hosts.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What can be a size of a time slot in TDM?
</summary>
Communication channel bandwidth / number of hosts.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the difference between Point-to-Point and Multi-Point communications?
</summary>
Point-to-Point - communication channel shared only between two devices or nodes. Multi-Point communication is a form of communication in which the channel is shared among multiple devices or nodes.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the broadcast communication principle?
</summary>
Message from one host is sent to all others. Each host, when receiving a message, checks it destination address: It reads a message, if it is destinated to it; Otherwise, it discards a message.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Which problems are raised in Multi-Point communication?
</summary>
Network congestion, security vulnerabilities and challenges with scalability.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the communication link?
</summary>
Link is a conceptÂ that indicates whether two devices are connected or not.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to distinguish different network nodes?
</summary>
IP address, MAC address, hostname.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What type of network addresses do you know?
</summary>
IPv4, IPv6.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Why do we need IPv4 and IPv6?
</summary>
IPv6 was introduced due to the lack of IPv4 addresses.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the router functionality?
</summary>
Device to forward/route data.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What Network Node Types do you know?
</summary>
Network hosts and intermediate networks hosts.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Do you know the different names for Network hosts and Intermediate Network hosts?
</summary>
Network hosts: source and destination hosts.
Intermediate Network hosts: routers, switches, bridges.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What devices may be included in Network Core?
</summary>
Intermediate routers and other network devices, providing communication between hosts.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the Routing Algorithm?
</summary>
Determines end-to-end communication path.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Why cannot we always use the shortest path?
</summary>
Routing algorithm has to account network load, aiming at minimizing network congestion.
</details>

## Internet - Organization Principles
### Home Network
- Connects devices within a close vinicity of a home;
- Typically has one Wi-Fi router;
- Local or Home Area Network (LAN, HAN).

### Local or Regional Internet Service Provides (ISP)
- Example: Tattelecolm;
- Provides an Internet connection to local communities or small regions;
- Services: IP address allocation, domain name registration, web hosting, etc.
- Owns MAN or WAN networks.

### Content Provider Network
- Servers network of a content provider (e.g. Youtube.com, Google.com);
- Numerous user requests are handled by different servers;
- Needed for handling simultaneous requests with acceptable quality (delay);
- Can be either **local** or geographically distributed network.

### Enterprise Network
- Midsize or large enterprise IT infrastructure;
- Local Area Network (LAN).

### Mobile Network
- A large-scale wireless network;
- Radio waves transmission medium;
- Multiple radio base stations over a large area;
- Mobile hosts dynamically reconnect between stations.

### National or Global Internet Service Providers (ISP)
- Some Russian national ISPs: Rostelecom, MTS, Relkom (Demos);
- Demos - the first ISP in Russia (1989) owning ".su" domain;
- Provide an Internet connection across a country;
- Services:
	- IP address allocation to local providers or end users;
	- domain name registration;
	- web hosting, etc.
- Operate with WAN network infrastructure (the Internet "backbone')

### Submarine Internet Infrastructure

### The Internet - the network of networks
Interconnects the hardware infrastructure of multiple ISPs;
**A "Nuts and Bolts" view** of the internet - Its entire hardware infrastructure:
	- Servers and Clients;
	- Routers, switches, and similar;
	- Communication links of all types.

**A "Services" view** of the Internet - Data transfer facilities to network applications:
- View streaming, web browsing, file distribution, and other facilities;
- No deep understanding of the Internet organization is needed for developing simple network applications.

### Internet Standards
**Request For Comments (RFC)** - informally is "the proposal for standards":
- Development proposals from interested parties;
- Not all RFCs become standards.

**Interned Engineering Task Force (IETF)** - maintains technical standards (e. g. IP protocol)

**The Interned Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)** - allocates IP addresses around the Globe.

`ls *` allows you to display the content of subdirectories as well
`ls -R` allows you to recursively retrieve the contents of subdirectories
`ls -l` displays the properties of files and directories. This command displays data as the following colums:
- *file type*: the very first letter indicates the file type. If a `-` is displayed, it is a regular file. If the letter `d` is displayed, then this is the directory.
- *permissions*: Immediately after the file type are the permissions assigned to this file. There are nine positions that show file access rights, for example, `rwxrwxr-x`.
- The number of links to the content.
- *ownership*: in Linux each file has a user owner and a group owner. 
- *size*
- *data and time of creation*
- *name*

`ls -a` displays hidden files as well
`ls -a -l` to output a command to a file.

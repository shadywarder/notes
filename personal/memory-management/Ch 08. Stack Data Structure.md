## Low Level Stack
In you've taken our data structures course, you've already implemented a <u>stack</u>. We're going to implement a stack again, but this time we're going to do it while manually managing the memory of generic pointers!

We'll get to have our first deeper exploration of "generics" in C (remember, that just means `void*`) as well as creating data structure we will later use in our mark-and-sweep garbage collector.

## Stack Push
Ok, let's actually store some data instead of just allocating memory for now practical purpose (a.k.a "haskell programming").

### Making Room 
As you know, our stack has a `count` and a `capacity`... but what happens when the `count` is equal to the `capacity`? We need to make room for more data!

We'll take a simple approach: whenever we run out of capacity, we'll double it. That way we don't have to reallocate memory on every push. For example:

|Count|Capacity|Data|
|---|---|---|
|0|4|[-, -, -, -]|
|1|4|[1, -, -, -]|
|2|4|[1, 2, -, -]|
|3|4|[1, 2, 3, -]|
|4|4|[1, 2, 3, 4]|
|5|8|[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -, -, -]|
> [!TIP]
> The `realloc` function is used to resize memory that was previously allocated with `malloc` or `calloc`. It takes a **pointer to the old memory** and new size, and returns a pointer to the new memory:
> 

```c
void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
```

```c
int *smol_boi = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
int *large_boi = realloc(smol_boi, 20 * sizeof(int));
```

## Stack Pop
As you *should* know by now, items go on and off the stack from the same end. (last in, first out).

Don't worry, the pop method is much simpler that the push method in our case, because we don't have to worry about resizing the stack.

## Stack Free
In C, we don't have a lot of abstractions at our disposal. There's now classes, destructors, functors, monads, made-up-category-theory-words, etc.

We've got *data*. And we've got *functions*. Just the way (((God))) Denis Ritchie intended.

So, to make it easier to work with our `Stack`, we're going to build own little `free` function that will clean up all the memory that we've allocated for our stack.

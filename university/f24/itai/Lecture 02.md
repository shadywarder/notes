### Turing Test
- Human vs. Computer
- Solved in some limited areas
- Inverse of this test uses as a human detector

### CAPTCHA aka Completely Automated Public Turing test to the Computers and Humans Apart

### Chinese Room Argument
- Thought experiment 
- Imagine yourself as someone who has no knowledge of the language of Chinese
	- Rather easy for most of us - but feel free to substitute any language you don't know
- You are locked in the room with a large book of instructions, a pile of paper, and two slots labeled in and out
- From the in slot comes a page of Chinese characters, the instructions tell you what to do and to write before putting in on the out slot

### Does This Mean That You KNOW Chinese?
- You don't know what the characters mean - semantics
- You know actions to be produced on symbols - syntax
- You will be slow to begin with, but as you learn the rule system you become better and better at your actions
- This is how a computer makes actions. But is it all it does?

### Arguments Against the Room
You are not processing meaningless symbols
- They have a meaning internally and a different external meaning
This might be only part of the bigger system
- Many Chinese rooms
- Who writes the rule book?
	- Can the rules be changed?
	- Development of rules in now part of many AI

**LAW THREE - SELF-PRESERVATION**

## Moments

The mean of a random variable $\xi$ is also called its *first moment*. Its *second moment* is defined as the mean of the random variable $\xi^2$. In general, the $n$-th moment of a random variable $\xi$, where $n$ is a positive integer, is the mean of the random variable $\xi^n$.

Variance (when it exists) satisfies the following properties:
1. It is always non-negative.
2. If the variance of a random variable $\xi$ is 0, then $\xi$ is almost surely a constant. More precisely: for some constant $c$, $\mathbb{P}(\xi=c)=1$.
3. If $c$ is a constant, then 
$$\text{Var} \ c\xi = c^2\text{Var} \ \xi$$
4. IF the variance of each $\xi_j, j = 1, ..., n$ exists, and if the random variables $\xi_1, ..., \xi_n$ are independent then
$$\text{Var}(\xi_1 + ... + \xi_n)=\text{Var} \ \xi_1 + ... + \text{Var} \ \xi_n$$

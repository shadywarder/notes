`find` is used to find files and directories by various criteria, such as name, size, type, and modification time. For example, we will find all `.txt` files in Documents directory of current user and its subdirectories:

```Shell
find ~/Documents -name "*.txt"
/home/eugene/Documents/test/hello.txt
```

`find` allows you not only to find files by its names. For example, you can find files by their size, owner, permissions, and many other parameters. 
- `-amin n`: found all files, that were last accessed less than `n` minutes ago. 
- `-executable`: found all executable files
- `-group name`: displays all files whose group owner is a user with the username "name"
- `-mmin n`: found all files, that were last modified less than `n` minutes ago. 
- `-newer file`: displays all files newer than `file`
- `-nogroup`, `-nouser`: displays all files which has no owner/group
- `-perm mode`: found all files, which have `mode` permission type
- `-size n`: found all files of size `n`. `find -size +2G` will found all files with size of more than 2 gigabytes.
- `-type t`: found files of a certain type.

We can actually combine different flags:

```shell
find -user eugene -size +100M
```

`whereis` is used to search for binaries, source files, and manual page files for a specific commands.

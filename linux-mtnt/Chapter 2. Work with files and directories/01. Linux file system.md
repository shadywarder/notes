The standard Linux directory system looks like this:

![[Pasted image 20240724202718.png]]

- `bin`: custom applications that can be run from the command line. These programs are available to all users. First of all, these are the necessary utilities and programs, such as `/bin/bash` (shell), `cp` (used to copy files), `cat`, `chmod`,  `grep`, `gzip`, `mkdir` and many others.
- `etc`: configuration system files, for example `passwd`,  `hosts`, `networks` etc.
- `boot`: it contains everything you need to boot the system. In particular, the kernel is a file named `vmlinuz`, as well as other vital components used to run the system.
- `sbin`: system applications needed primarily for system administration, such as `fdisk`, `ifconfig`, `reboot`, etc. These are critical binaries that should always be available in case you need to restore your system.
- `usr`: user applications and data (analogous to the Program Files directory in Windows). Main sub directories:
	- `/usr/bin`: most of the user applications
	- `/usr/src`: source files of applications
	- `/usr/include`: standard C header files
	- `/usr/lib`: development files and installable packages
	- `/usr/local`: local applications
	- `/usr/share`: static shared data

- `var`: data files, that can be changed. Main sub directories:
	- `/var/cache`: applications cache
	- `/var/include`: standard C header files
	- `/var/lib`: data about system state
	- `/var/lock`: blocked data for tracking used resources
	- `/var/log`: log files
	- `/var/opt`: data of installed packages
	- `/var/spool`: tasks performed
	- `/var/tmp`: temporary files that are deleted after a new system boot
- `/dev`: device files. In Linux, all the hardware you work with corresponds to a file on the system. If you need to access the hardware, then you need to access the appropriate file. This will require root permissions.
- `/home`: folder for users' home directories
- `/lib`: shared library files that can be used by other applications. You can also find some other important modules in this directory, such as driver modules that are used by the Linux kernel. For 64-bit library files, there is a directory named `/lib64`.
- `/media`: the default directory for mounting removable devices in the system, in particular USB-connected devices such as removable hard drives, SSDs, flash drives. etc. A subdirectory is automatically created in this directory when a new removable device is detected.
- `/mnt`: on older system versions represented the default directory for mounting devices. Now this role is generally performed by the `/media` directory. However, `/mnt` is still used to for mounting, which doesn't happen very often and is created manually, for example, to mount to a server that needs to be accessed only once. The `/mnt` is also suitable for testing purposes.
- `/opt`: additional user applications. In contrast with `/usr` directory in `/opt` usually located more heavy files, there is no common opinion though, what should be located in `/usr` and what in `/opt`.
- `/proc`: processors files, info about kernel and machine.
- `/root`: home directory for `root` user or superuser. Home directories of common users usually takes place in `/home`. System administrator isn't a usual user; Therefore, in UNIX, the system administrator is considered a "superuser". Since this user may have some important tools in his home directory, this directory isn't located in `/home` with tools of the other users. Instead, `root` user uses `/root` as their home directory.
- `/run`: used for configuration during runtime. In this directory can be created separate subdirectories for different users and processes, and each of them can create files in these subdirectories. Files in `/run` typically deleted automatically, when they are no longer needed. 
- `/srv`: stores files of some important services. For example, it is used to store entire file structure of your web server and FTP server in SUSE Linux. Some distros, such as Red Hat and its derivatives, don't use `/srv`, but store this type of information in `/var`.
- `/sys`: it is used to store info about the state of the system. This directory is similar to the `/proc` directory, with the difference that the info in `/sys` is stored on the hard disk, so it still available after reboot. The info in `/sys` is more directly related to the hardware, whereas `/proc` is used to store information about the current state of the kernel.
- `/tmp`: stores temporary files, automatically deleted on reboot.
